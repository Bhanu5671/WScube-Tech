I have developed a website for WsCube Tech, a renowned coaching institute. The project was built using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on clean design and usability. To enhance its accessibility and ensure a seamless user experience across various devices, I implemented responsive design techniques using media queries. This approach ensures that the website adapts beautifully to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on both mobile and desktop platforms.
